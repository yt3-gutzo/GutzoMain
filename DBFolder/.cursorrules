# Global Rules

You must always consider the context from the following SQL files when answering questions or performing tasks involving database schema, data flow, or backend logic:

- `nodebackend/SupabaseSelfhostSqlFiles/backup.sql`

If any other `.sql` files are added to the project, please consider them as well particularly when making changes to the database or understanding the data model.

# File Creation Rules
Any new SQL files created should be placed in this `DBFolder` directory.

# Environment Variable Rules
Do not add fallbacks/defaults for `process.env` variables (e.g., `process.env.VAR || 'default'`). Let the application fail if the variable is missing.
